<h2>AutoTutor</h2>
<h3>Download Link:</h3>
<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/autotutor/id1085420154?ls=1&mt=8" target="_blank">Free (limited time), iOS App Store</a></p>


<h3>Description</h3>
<p>You're in grades 1 - 8 and you're getting bad grades in your math class? Hey, it's okay, lots of people have trouble with math. That's why AutoTutor's here! You see, math is a really important (arguably the most important) subject at school, and it's super important that you excel in it. The reason it's super important is because every job you can possibly get uses math in some shape. From being a fast food worker to being the CEO of a huge megacorporation, math is all around you. </p>
<p>Now, you see, math will help you get further in life. However, if you have difficulties in it, that's perfectly normal, and you shouldn't feel ashamed of yourself. But you should, however, try to improve your skills. AutoTutor is an app that will help you do exactly that, for a super low price! When you're practicing, AutoTutor will even explain how to solve each problem, so you can follow the steps and learn how to do it, perhaps even giving you a new perspective on how to solve the problem, which could be a way you understand better.</p>
<p>For parents/legal guardians, hiring a tutor, even a teenage tutor that you can't really trust in terms of quality, can be very expensive. Most will be above $15 per hour. I think that's outrageous. AutoTutor is here to help your child with math skills in a way that you can observe and confirm quality, but at a single price, multiple times lower than most human tutors' hourly rates. Doesn't that sound great? I think so. AutoTutor's quality is ensured by the fact that its questions are loosely based on the official Ontarian mathematics curriculum (you can view it <a href="https://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/curriculum/elementary/math18curr.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>), a curriculum used to educate over one million students in mathematics across Ontario.</p>
<p>AutoTutor is even also able to be used as a tool for teachers and tutors. If you acquire the Tutor Codes for AutoTutor (more information on that below, in the black box), you can unlock all of the levels from the start, enabling you to use AutoTutor as a tool to make learning more interactive, more interesting. AutoTutor can be used as a way to do different exercises for each concept to help your student improve their skills, with less effort for you.<p>
<p>Some great AutoTutor features:</p>
<ul>
	<li>360 great questions included with the app!</li>
	<li>Over 80 quality graphics bundled with the app used to complement a number of the questions to help students visualize what is required!</li>
	<li>Very low price point! (Free at launch for limited time)</li>
	<li>One-time cost! (Free at launch for limited time)</li>
	<li>Free updates will improve the app in the future!</li>
	<li>More questions will come in the future, increasing the question number to an even higher number!</li>
	<li>Great explanations to help students understand math concepts!</li>
	<li>Math is calculated by the DDMathParser framework by Dave DeLong, a well-known and trusted framework!</li>
</ul>
<p>AutoTutor is designed to be used with iPad, but can be used on-the-go with your iPhone or iPod touch. All devices compatible with iOS 9.0 are compatible with AutoTutor. (Note: AutoTutor is compatible with iPhone 4S, but it is recommended to use it with an iPhone 5 or newer)</p>
