<h2>What is LBAS?</h2>
<p>LBAS stands for Low Budget Animation Studios. It is a sub-company run by Kiayeorg. We animate the KIAYE Episodes on Vine, and are building an iOS game that we would like to release in the near future.

<h2>Is there anything you guys have made that we can check out?</h2>
<p>Yes! Right now, you can check out our <a href="https://vine.co/Kiaye" target="_blank">Kiaye Episodes</a>, and  you can follow us on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/Sn0wCh1ld" target="_blank">@Sn0wCh1ld</a> for more information on our upcoming iOS app. Technically, <a href="http://smallcut.weebly.com/p34ch.html" target="_blank">this</a> is also ours, but it's a game that was never completed, and never will be. It was also created when we weren't called LBAS, and Kiayeorg wasn't even around yet.

<h2>What's with your name?</h2>
<p>Well, we are extremely low budget (the only thing paid for was the Mac used for development and we will purchase a subscription to the iOS developer program), and we animate stuff, like cartoons and the upcoming game.

<h2>I checked Sn0wCh1ld's Twitter. He's been working on an app for over a year and it's not out yet?</h2>
<p>Not exactly. You see, the first app was called "Gnop" and never came out, because the way it was built wasn't very good, and when iOS 8 came out, it broke. It was completely unfixable, so he started on the new app - the right way. That app has been in development for a couple months, but school slowed it down. It's ready now, but it needs some more content, and money for the iOS developer program subscription.

<h2>How broke are you guys?</h2>
<p>Very.

<h2>Can I help?</h2>
<p>Yes! You can press that little donate button on the navigation bar to donate via PayPal.
