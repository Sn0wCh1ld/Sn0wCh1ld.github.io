<h2>Bullying</h2>
<p>Bullying is a real issue that we face today. It can cause emotional problems for the victims, and the bully must live with the guilt of their actions, as well as other consequences. There are many laws concerning bullying, making most forms of it illegal (in Canada). Also, many forms of bullying may also require other activities that are illegal (theft, illegal possession of a weapon, hate crime, harassment to the point of fear of safety, etc), which could possibly end the bully up with severe consequences like imprisonment and a tarnished permanent record. Also, to those that think that bullying can make them popular or cool, it actually can't. By definition, "popular" means that "regarded with favor, approval, or affection by people in general" (via <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com" target="_blank">dictionary.reference.com</a>) , or in simpler terms, "popular" means that you are liked by many people. As a bully, you will not be liked by that many people, and therefore, cannot be popular. As for being cool, coolness is dependent on the fact that your group thinks you're cool. If you don't have a group, they can't think you're cool, and therefore, you will be forever uncool. And even if you are a bully for other reasons, the consequences will still be the same. Plus there will be the guilt that you will have to live with forever, the fact that you may have ruined a person's life, or contributed to its end. Not very pleasant to have to live with for the rest of your life, is it? To those who witness bullying, report it. You probably don't wanna be thought of as the "snitch", so do it anonymously. If your school/organization has an anonymous online bullying reporting service, use it. You can also see your superior (teacher, boss, etc) after class or at work to report it, but if you do so, make sure they're trustworthy. You wouldn't want the word to leak out. You could even leave a note with them (on their desk or something) addressing the issue when no one is looking, or send them a message from a throwaway account (email, Twitter, etc). Bullies must be stopped, and without them, the world would be a much better place. If you attend ÉSC Saint-Charles-Garnier, you may complete a form to report bullying anonymously.
