<h1>How to bypass OurPact (probably)</h1>
</div>


<div id="content">
<p><b>NOTE:</b> As of February 3rd, 2017, the workarounds may have been patched in a newer version of OurPact than was used to develop this 
guide. Though the profile will still be removed, granting you freedom on your device, if the patch works, then the notification and 
email will unfortunately not be stopped. I hope it still works, but as an OurPact developer 
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/5lqd6y/figured_some_of_you_guys_parents_might_have/dd9e5iw/?context=3"> said on Reddit</a>, 
use at your own risk.</p>


<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>OurPact is a tool that allows parents to take near-absolute control over their children's devices. I've personally never been subjected
to it, but I've met people who have had it installed on their phones, and I really felt bad for them. I've come to despise the program,
and I want to help anyone controlled by it to have a way out. Here are two guides to beating OurPact, each with increasing difficulty, 
but also with increasing effectiveness. The guides are only for iOS devices.</p>
<p>The first guide <i>should</i> remove OurPact your iOS device without notifying the parent. Effective against most parents</p>
<p>The second guide <i>should</i> remove OurPact your iOS device without notifying the parent. It will also add a new profile
that looks like the official OurPact profile. If a parent checked their child's Settings app, they would not be easily able to tell the 
profile had been tampered with. Effective against most curious/relatively tech savvy/relatively untrusting parents</p>


<br>

<h2>Shorter Guide</h2>

<h3>Step 1</h3>
<p>Enable Airplane mode on your device.</p>

<h3>Step 2</h3>
<p>In the Settings app, navigate to General > Device Management.</p>

<h3>Step 3</h3>
<p>Select "Device System Profile", with the name "OurPact" underneath it.</p>

<h3>Step 4</h3>
<p>Press "Remove Management" and put in your password. When prompted, press remove.</p>

<h3>Step 5</h3>
<p>Once the profile is removed, press the home button and power button until you see an Apple logo.</p>

<h3>Step 6</h3>
<p>When the device is booted back up, unlock it, turn off Airplane mode, and hope it worked.</p>

<br>

<h2>More Effective Guide</h2>

<h3>Step 1</h3>
<p>On your iOS device, copy <a href="../Files/ourhact.mobileconfig">this</a> link and send it to yourself (preferably using the Messages 
app).

<h3>Step 2</h3>
<p>Enable Airplane mode on your device.</p>

<h3>Step 3</h3>
<p>In the Settings app, navigate to General > Device Management.</p>

<h3>Step 4</h3>
<p>Select "Device System Profile", with the name "OurPact" underneath it.</p>

<h3>Step 5</h3>
<p>Press "Remove Management" and put in your password. When prompted, press remove.</p>

<h3>Step 6</h3>
<p>Once the profile is removed, press the home button and power button until you see an Apple logo.</p>

<h3>Step 7</h3>
<p>When the device is booted back up, unlock it.</p>

<h3>Step 8</h3>
<p>Go to the Messages app and copy the link you sent yourself.</p>

<h3>Step 9</h3>
<p>Go to Safari, and paste the link in the navigation bar.</p>

<h3>Step 10</h3>
<p>Before pressing "Go", disable Airplane mode and wait for your device to connect to Wi-Fi.</p>

<h3>Step 11</h3>
<p>Press go, and wait for the Settings app to pop up.</p>

<h3>Step 12</h3>
<p>Press install, and go through the installation process (you will have to put in your password).</p>

<h3>Step 13</h3>
<p>Hope it worked!</p> 

<h3>Step 14</h3>
<p>Go back to the Messages app and delete the message(s) containing the link you sent yourself. Do the same on other devices that also
receive your messages.</p>

<p>I worked pretty hard developing these methods, but I when I got stumped, I searched around a little and found 
<a href="https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20160607095601AAjFnpt">this Yahoo Answers post</a>. User Jai's answer helped quite a 
bit with the actual bypassing of OurPact, so I'd just like to give credit. All the rest of the material in this guide is original.</p>
