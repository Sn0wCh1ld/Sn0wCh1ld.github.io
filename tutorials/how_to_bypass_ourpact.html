<h1>How to bypass OurPact (probably)</h1>
</div>

<div id="content">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>OurPact is a tool that allows parents to take near-absolute control over their children's devices. I've personally never been subject
to it, but I've met people who have had it installed on their phones, and I really felt bad for them. I've come to despise the program,
and I want to help anyone controlled by it to have a way our. Here are two guides to beating OurPact, each with increasing difficulty, 
but also with increasing effectiveness. The guides are only for iOS devices.</p>
<p>The first guide <i>should</i> remove OurPact your iOS device without notifying the parent. Effective against most parents</p>
<p>The second guide <i>should</i> remove OurPact your iOS device without notifying the parent. It will also add a new profile
that looks like the official OurPact profile. If a parent checked the Settings app, they would not be easily able to tell the 
profile had been tampered with. Effective against most curious/relatively 
tech savvy/relatively untrusting parents</p>


<br>

<h2>Easier Guide</h2>

<h3>Step 1</h3>
<p>Enable Airplane mode on your device.</p>

<h3>Step 2</h3>
<p>In the Settings app, navigate to General > Device Management.</p>

<h3>Step 3</h3>
<p>Select "Device System Profile", with the name "OurPact" underneath it.</p>

<h3>Step 4</h3>
<p>Press "Remove Management" and put in your password. When prompted, press remove.</p>

<h3>Step 5</h3>
<p>Once the profile is removed, press the home button and power button until you see an Apple logo.</p>

<h3>Step 6</h3>
<p>When the device is booted back up, unlock it, turn off Airplane mode, and hope it worked.</p>

<br>

<h2>Harder Guide</h2>

<h3>Step 1</h3>
<p>On your iOS device, copy <a href="../Files/OurHact.mobileconfig">this</a> link and iMessage it to yourself.

<h3>Step 2</h3>
<p>Enable Airplane mode on your device.</p>

<h3>Step 3</h3>
<p>In the Settings app, navigate to General > Device Management.</p>

<h3>Step 4</h3>
<p>Select "Device System Profile", with the name "OurPact" underneath it.</p>

<h3>Step 5</h3>
<p>Press "Remove Management" and put in your password. When prompted, press remove.</p>

<h3>Step 6</h3>
<p>Once the profile is removed, press the home button and power button until you see an Apple logo.</p>

<h3>Step 7</h3>
<p>When the device is booted back up, unlock it.</p>

<h3>Step 8</h3>
<p>Go to the messages app and copy the link you sent yourself.</p>

<h3>Step 9</h3>
<p>Go to Safari, and paste the link in the navigation bar.</p>

<h3>Step 10</h3>
<p>Before pressing "Go", disable Airplane mode and wait for your device to connect to Wi-Fi.</p>

<h3>Step 11</h3>
<p>Press go, and wait for the Settings app to pop up.</p>

<h3>Step 12</h3>
<p>Press install, and go through the installation process (you will have to put in your password).</p>

<h3>Step 13</h3>
<p>Hope it worked!</p>

<p>Hopefully my methods worked for you! I'll update the guide if I discover a new way to get around the AdBlock blockers. If you like
