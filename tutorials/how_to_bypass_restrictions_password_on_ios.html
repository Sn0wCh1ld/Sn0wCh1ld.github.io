<h1>How to bypass restrictions password on iOS</h1>
<p>Based on my string of tweets that began <a href="https://twitter.com/JustinAlexP/status/748583625357135873">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>On iOS, under Settings > General > Restrictions, the restrictions settings can be found.. They are there for parents who want to 
limit the capability of their children's devices. They can disable Siri, Camera, Safari, installing or deleting apps and in-app purchases, 
among other things. They can also set ratings limits for content (for example, disabling the purchase or download of apps rated 17+ or 
movies rated R). But what do you do if you can't remember the password, your friends enabled restrictions, or even your parents turned them
on, and you want to disable them without restoring your device? You crack the password! This is what you'll learn to do in this tutorial.</p>

<br>


<h2>Guide</h2>

<h3>Step 1</h3>
<p>Download iBackupBot for your OS from <a href="http://www.icopybot.com/download.htm">this website.</a></p>

<h3>Step 2</h3>
<p>Install, then run it</p>

<h3>Step 3</h3>
<p>Select your device, then navigate to System Files/HomeDomain/Library/Preferences/com.apple.restrictionspassword.plist</p>

<h3>Step 4</h3>
<p>Find RestrictionsPasswordKey and RestrictionsPasswordSalt</p>

<h3>Step 5</h3>
<p>Go to <a href="http://1024kb.co.nz/ios-7-8-9-10-passcode-hack/">this webpage</a>.</p>

<h3>Step 6</h3>
<p>At the bottom of the webpage, there are four fields: RestrictionsPasswordKey, RestrictionsPasswordSalt, Starting Passcode and End 
Passcode. Put the info from iBackupBot (RestrictionsPasswordKey and RestrictionsPasswordSalt) in the appropriate field. If you know
the password is higher and/or lower than a certain number, you can set up the Starting Passcode and End Passcode fields. If you don't
have any clue, or you don't know what those fields do, then just leave them at 0000 and 9999, respectively.</p>

<h3>Step 7</h3>
<p>Wait for the website to get the password. Do not leave the webpage. Leave the webpage open, do not switch screens to go to a different
app. While you wait, you can follow me on Twitter <a href="https://www.twitter.com/JustinAlexP" target="_blank"></span>@JustinAlexP</a>
for more tech stuff, and updates when new tutorials come out.</p>

<h3>Step 8</h3>
<p>Once the website has found the password, use it to unlock, and then disable or change your restrictions.</p>

<br>


<p>That's it, you've broken into the restrictions on iOS! If you like these tutorials or you want to hear more from me, please follow
