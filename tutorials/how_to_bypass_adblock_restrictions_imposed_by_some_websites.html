<h1>How to bypass AdBlock restrictions imposed by some websites</h1>
</div>

<div id="content">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Whether it's Adblock Plus, uBlock Origin, or some other content blocker, having an ad blocker on is always a good idea. It increases
the security on your computer by blocking potentially malicious ads and other undesirable content, makes websites look and feel
cleaner and makes websites load faster, among other things. However, some websites don't like when you block their ads, and in return,
they don't allow you to see their content. But what if you want to read those articles without compromising your security or convenience?
This tutorial is here to help. I'll update it if I come across new methods to get around the problem.</p>
<p>If any method works for you, you don't really need to read the rest</p>

<br>

<h2>Guide</h2>

<h3>Temporarily disable Javascript</h3>
<p>Some websites detect adblockers by running some javascript, so disabling it may fix your issue.</p>
<p>Each browser is different, but in my main browser, Safari, it is done by first enabling the Devlope menu. This is done by going to 
Safari Preferences (Safari menu bar button, then preferences), then to Advanced, then ticking the checkbox that says "Show Develop menu 
in menu bar". Close that window, then in the menu bar, open the Develop menu, and click on Disable Javascript. When you're done with the
website, re-enable Javascript by going back to the Develop menu, and clicking Disable Javascript again.</p>
<p>You can follow <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Disable-JavaScript">this WikiHow article</a> to learn how to disable javascript in
some other browsers.</p>

<h3>Use inspect element to remove the "disable AdBlock" overlay</h3>
<p>Sometimes, all you have to do is delete the offending part of the website. Right click on the page, and click "Inspect Element".
Every modern browser should have a similar function. Inspect Element will come up, and you have to select the "Select" tool. It usually
looks like a crosshair or a mouse by a window. Hover over the overlay, and it should light up. Click it. Inside Inspect Element,
some HTML should now be highlighted. Click the delete key on your keyboard. If it doesn't work, try deleting other things that may
be part of the overlay. Make sure you don't delete the main content!</p>

<h3>Use AdBlock Plus' Block Element feature</h3>
<p>I'm not sure if other blockers have this, but AdBlock Plus has a Block Element feature that acts similarly to the Inspect Element
method I just talked about. Click the "Block Element" button in the AdBlock Plus menu and then click on the overlay. A new tab should
open up asking if you want to block that element. Say yes. You can undo it later by going to the "Options" section under the AdBlock
Plus menu, then to "Add your own filters", and from there, removing the blocked elements from the list.</p>

<p>Hopefully my methods worked for you! I'll update the guide if I discover a new way to get around the AdBlock blockers. If you like
