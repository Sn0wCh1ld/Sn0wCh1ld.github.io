displayintro: Learn how to secretly screenshot a snap on Snapchat
---
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Snapchat is a popular social media service that allows you to send photos and videos that supposedly disappear once a certain period of time is elapsed. Of course, sometimes, you receive a snap that you want to save forever, so you screenshot it. However, screenshotting a snap sends a notification to the original sender, which notifies them of your screenshot. So how do you get around that limitation? You follow this guide, which uses a flaw in Snapchat's screenshot detection system.</p>
<p>This tutorial may seem like a lot to remember at first, but you can always come back here to make sure you remember everything. Also, it gets a lot easier once you've done it a lot, and you end up breaking it down to about 4 steps, which I've included at the end.</p>

<h2>Things You'll Need</h2>
<ul>
<li>iOS device</li>
<li>Snapchat app</li>
</ul>

<h2>Guide</h2>
<div class="tutorialguide">
<h3>Step 1</h3>
<p>Open Snapchat, and determine which snap you want to screenshot</p>
<p>If you've already opened the snap you want to save, just let the time run out, then tap and hold on the snap to use a Replay on it. Do not open the replayed snap yet</p>
<h3>Step 2</h3>
<p>Make sure the snap is loaded. You will know the snap is loaded when it says "Tap to view" under the contact name, instead of "Tap to load".</p>
<h3>Step 3</h3> 
<p>Turn on Airplane mode.</p>
<h3>Step 4</h3> 
<p>Open the snap and screenshot it.</p>
<h3>Step 5</h3> 
<p>Press and hold the power button until you see "Slide to power off". DO NOT POWER DOWN OR LOCK THE DEVICE, OR THE NOTIFICATION WILL GO THROUGH.</p>
<h3>Step 6</h3> 
<p>Press and hold the home button (as if you're trying to summon Siri) until Snapchat "crashes" to the homescreen. If it looks like it's about to "crash", but Snapchat opens immediately, repeat this step until you've either done it at least 4 or 5 times, or it crashes to the homescreen, whichever happens first.</p>
<p>Following steps 5 and 6 in any app on iOS apparently clears the cache or the device's RAM.</p>
<h3>Step 7</h3> 
<p>Turn off Airplane mode, and wait for your Internet connection to reconnect.</p>
<h3>Step 8</h3> 
<p>Open Snapchat and verify that no screenshot has been sent. You should also be able to view the screenshotted snap as if you had never opened it (once everything loads). If you see that a screenshot has been sent, then you most likely messed up either step 5 or step 6.</p>
