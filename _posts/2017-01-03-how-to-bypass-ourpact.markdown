<h2>Note</h2>
<p>As of February 3rd, 2017, the workarounds may have been patched in a newer version of OurPact than was used to develop this guide. Though the profile will still be removed, granting you freedom on your device, if the patch works, then the notification and email will unfortunately not be stopped. I hope it still works, but as an OurPact developer <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/5lqd6y/figured_some_of_you_guys_parents_might_have/dd9e5iw/?context=3">said on Reddit</a>, use at your own risk.<p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>OurPact is a tool that allows parents to take near-absolute control over their children's devices. I've personally never been subjected to it, but I've met people who have had it installed on their phones, and I really felt bad for them. I've come to despise the program, and I want to help anyone controlled by it to have a way out. Here are two guides to beating OurPact, each with increasing difficulty, but also with increasing effectiveness. The guides are only for iOS devices.</p>
<p>The first guide should remove OurPact your iOS device without notifying the parent. Effective against most parents.</p>
<p>The second guide should remove OurPact your iOS device without notifying the parent. It will also add a new profile that looks like the official OurPact profile. If a parent checked their child's Settings app, they would not be easily able to tell the profile had been tampered with. Effective against most curious/relatively tech savvy/relatively untrusting parents.</p>

<p>I worked pretty hard developing these methods, but I when I got stumped, I searched around a little and found <a href="https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20160607095601AAjFnpt">this Yahoo Answers post</a>. User Jai's answer helped quite a bit with the actual bypassing of OurPact, so I'd just like to give credit. All the rest of the material in this guide is original.</p>
